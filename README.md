February 7, 2024:
I will be developing a Flask chat application that will allow you to talk with people over the internet.

This application was developed for CS50X, Harvard's online introduction to computer science course. 
Please note that this application uses environment variables for the feedback sending aspect, so if
you would like to utilise that feature, you will have to make a .env file in the directory and add
your email and app password.
